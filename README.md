Of course! I will give you a general explanation of the guessing script.
The guessing script is a program used to test security and evaluate the strength of passwords and guess them to access protected accounts or items. This type of encryption is used for legitimate purposes such as testing the strength of weak corporate passwords or testing the security of your own system.
2. Build the script: Use a programming language like Python or Bash to build the guessing script. You can use the available libraries and tools to ease the guessing process such as `requests` in Python to send HTTP requests or tools such as `hydra` to handle login.

3. Executing the Guessing Process: Run the script to start trying the possible passwords on the specified target. You can configure the script to repeat the experiment repeatedly using the list of broken passwords
